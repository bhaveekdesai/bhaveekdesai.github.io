Absolute, so absolutely absurd  
An entity's identifiable existence  
Is derived from being anything but  

There is no white without black  
There is no black without white  

A day is a day  
Because there's a night.  
Thank the feeble and the weak  
For without them,  
There is no existence of might.  

You are you, because I am me  
If I were you, while you were you,  
Would there really be 'you'?  

The only kind of absolute  
Is the one residing in relativity.  
Thank the striking juxtaposition  
For without it,  
There is no identity.
