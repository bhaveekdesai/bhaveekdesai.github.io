A morning, unusually chilling  
A cup of hot tea, steaming  
Kept by the window  
A bit too early to sip on  

The water is liberated  
As it leaves the cup vaporized  
Fogs the glass pane  
Fogs the view of the fog outside  

The clouds are darker today  
But what do I know?  
The world outside is blurry  
So exhilaratingly murky  

A gentle swipe cleans off the resting moisture  
The world outside, hauntingly forsaken  
The trees are naked  
The ground is leaf-laden  

Each leaf, rusty brown  
Every tree, as if missing its crown  
The fog clears like the vapors off the cup  
And the universe is awakened by a loud slurp
