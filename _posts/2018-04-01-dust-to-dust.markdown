Guarded by an iron door,  
The king sits on his throne;  
Without a care in the world,  
Couldn't have asked for more  

When the wars were waged,  
He sought a shred of symphony  
Amidst the sorrow, loss and despair  
And all the ugly cacophony.  

Green fields turned red,  
And then, from red to black.  
The inexorable putrefaction  
Never did bring anyone back.  

A moment of clarity, when dawned  
The king stepped off his throne;  
Repenting the lives he had taken  
If only sooner had he known-  

Strolling through the cosmos,  
We're but a mere speck of dust.  
This pale blue dot we reside on,  
Has been kind and harsh, but always just.  

The long lullaby of life,  
Would bring everyone to sleep;  
And the universe shall go on  
With just memories to keep.  

In the grand scheme of things,  
All the wars are futile;  
And the unfathomable time shall reduce  
The kingdoms to rubble, and pile.
