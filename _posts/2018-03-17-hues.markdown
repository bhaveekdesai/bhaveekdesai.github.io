The hues come by,  
As captured by the eye.  
Reflected on the ocean blue  
So dark, the horizon demarcates the view  
Of the blues and the elements.  
A distant light shimmers,  
Seducing*© Bhaveek Desai*
 the vessel playing  
To whims of the mighty waves waving.  
Gusts of wind, however,  
Have a different plan altogether.  
As the carrier sways playfully  
Back and forth to the rhythm  
Of nature, amidst the disharmony,  
The focus returns to the light.  
Solace, it seeks foremost;  
Before sailing back in the hues again,  
Before departing off the coast.
