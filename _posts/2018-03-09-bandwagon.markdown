Oh, the bandwagon is here  
Get on board before it leaves  
It's okay, it is safe;  
We're all hunters here.  

And you can be one of us  
Oh, you ought to be one of us  
Because it isn't safe out there.  
There, they lack caliber  
Which we got loads  
Which keeps us off danger  

So, come board the bandwagon  
The problem with the world is not us.  
We're all hunters here  
The problem with the world is that it is not us.  

Oh, but mind is such a whimsical organ  
You see, a finger twitches  
And the fantasy satiates.  
I'm sorry, did I hurt you?  
Told ya, it isn't safe out there  
Told ya, you ought to be one of us  

You're safe here.  
We fulfill our fantasies, so can you.  
Just one question though..  
You aren't insane, are you?
