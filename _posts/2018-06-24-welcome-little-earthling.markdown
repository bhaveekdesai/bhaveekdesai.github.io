Welcome little earthling,  
Welcome home.  
We've just baby-proofed your dwelling;  
You've arrived just in time.  

Let's start with something fun,  
How about a little presentation?  
Don't worry little one,  
It's just a part of your naturalization.  

Observe your brothers and sisters;  
That is how you duck  
When you hear the bangs,  
Else you're just outta luck.  

Oh, and by the way,  
You're gonna be popular soon.  
Because you're gifted  
With an extra X chromosome.  

Ugly hands would find their way;  
That they always do.  
But don't you sweat dear,  
We're all here for you.  

Well, for some time though.  
Amnesiacs, you see, we all are  
Ah! We forget in a few days.  
No, no, we've not lowered any bar  

A color, one you like the least,  
You'll have to choose.  
And decide from your palette,  
That you'd want to lose.  

Smile, little one,  
Give your best pose.  
Portray your best self;  
Filter those flaws.  

When authenticity departs  
And adulteration is the norm,  
You gotta find that sweet angle  
That highlights your form.  

While your siblings cry,  
You cry for a while too  
Just to make them feel better;  
The phone is where you go back to.  

Tolerance? You don't need  
To know the meaning.  
You're the center of the universe  
With stars around revolving.  

Don't mind the futility  
Of our global discussions.  
We're occupied pointing fingers  
And tap dancing our thumbs  

So, welcome!  
Get habituated, little one  
For this is your home  
Here's your phone, and a gun.
