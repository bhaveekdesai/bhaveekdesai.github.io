Swaying to the occasional breeze,  
The supple movements of the sign old  
Squeak, as the rusty hinges fold and unfold.  
And mark its presence  
On a quiet Saturday afternoon.  
The coffee shop has seen better times,  
When the bell on the door chimes  
Almost always bustling with people  
Craving for that much needed vigor.  
But on a day such as this,  
When the sun is hard to miss.  
And it blankets the town to the brick  
With its sultry, golden fabric.  
The town takes a nap,  
Like a child snoozing on a mother's lap.
