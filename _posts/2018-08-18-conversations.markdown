Little, elaborate, vivid  
Conversations  
Segmented by bits of pauses  
Our train of thoughts swoosh  
Separated by gawking silences  

Frivolous, thoughtful, thoughtless  
Reflections  
We gaze at each other's psyche  
I see you as you are  
I am, as you see me  

Memories fail at history  
I listen to you, yet  
With all my intent  

When consciousness eludes  
And sleep creeps in  
The words lose the social construct  
What remains, is a singular thought  
Unhinged, untamed, naked  
The incomprehensible sentences  
And the contemplative dialogues  
I long for us to share  
Conversations, of all sorts.
