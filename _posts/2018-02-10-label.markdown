Label, a human conception  
Originates from the urge of belonging  
And stays deep rooted to the point  
The human becomes the label itself,  
And forgets its true form.  

A finger pointing at the moon  
Is always a finger, never the moon.  

You despise me, because I'm some label  
Does it matter, what label am I?  
If I love you, because you're some label  
Therefore, I love you, the label,  
I do not love you, the human.  

This facade that we live with  
Is a wildly primordial farce.  
Stripped off our tags and our names,  
We're manufactured but the same.
