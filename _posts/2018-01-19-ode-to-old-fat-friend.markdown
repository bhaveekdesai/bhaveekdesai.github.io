It's been a long time, most of my life, actually,  
We've been together  
I despised the fact how fat you were  
And how you hated my nose  
But over these years,  
We did grow comfortable of each other  

You've successfully scared people away from me,  
But also attracted a lot of bullies  
At times you'd take a bullet for me,  
And I'd joke about you being bulletproof  
Because of the fact how fat you were.  

Well, I do have a lot of things to blame you for  
And a lot more to be grateful for  
You're why I am what I am-  
An outcast, an introvert, a daydreamer  
You're the reason why I am what I am-  
A word junkie, a thinker, a rhymer  

Despite all of that, I could count on you  
You do bring out the minuscule details around me  
Really make me appreciate the little things  
Enable me to look at things more critically,  
And just make them ostensibly clearer  

When we see eye to eye,  
The world is more than just glances  
Because I see through you-  
My fat, unattractive glasses
