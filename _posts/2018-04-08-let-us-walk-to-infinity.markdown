Let us walk to infinity  
Hand in hand, along the serenity  
Of this beach we call life.  
And experience every shade of it, while  
The trails of our footprints  
Have been dancing on and off,  
But never less than a set of  
Two, one me and one you.  
Let us walk to infinity;  
You and I, as I dream  
Of spending my life with you  
And as I hope, you dream too.
