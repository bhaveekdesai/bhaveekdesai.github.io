*Â© Bhaveek Desai*

Don't have to;  
These words don't have to  
Convey anything, no feeling,  
No emotion, no story.  
There's no telling  
When the boat of thought  
Would stop sailing  
On the stream of conscious awakening,  
And currents of subconscious sleeping.  
Row as you may, as you wish,  
Or not; don't have to;  
The rowing don't have to stop,  
Or even continue, for that matter.  
Let go of the faux clench,  
And let the moment own the moment
