A banana peel,  
Traveling ticketless in a bus  
Occupies this seat  
Attracts scathing eyes  
Of fellow passengers.  

Tough crowd, tough indeed  
Dejects this rejected seal  
Although a human it did feed.  
Never hurt anybody,  
Poor banana peel  

Life's too brief  
For a peel such as this  
Especially when it transits  
Noticeably unnoticed.
